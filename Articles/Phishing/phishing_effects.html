                <h2> What Do Phishing, Vishing, and Smishing Do? </h2>
                 <p> Each of these scams works in different ways, but all share the same goal: to steal your personal information. 
                    Here's how each one operates: 
                 </p>
                 <ol>
                    <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> - Phishing is when scammers send fake emails pretending to be from legitimate companies, like banks or online stores. These emails usually contain links that lead to fake websites designed to steal your personal information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vishing (Voice Phishing):</strong> - Vishing happens when fraudsters call you on the phone, pretending to be someone from a trusted organization, such as a bank or government agency. They might ask you to confirm personal information or claim thereâ€™s an issue with your account that needs immediate attention. These calls are usually designed to make you panic and give away sensitive data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smishing (SMS Phishing):</strong> - Smishing is similar to phishing, but instead of emails, scammers use text messages. These texts usually contain links or phone numbers that lead to fake websites or call centers. The goal is to trick you into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or credit card details.</li>
                 </ol>
