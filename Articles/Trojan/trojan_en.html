            <h2>What is Trojan Malware?</h2>
            <p>A Trojan, or Trojan horse, is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into downloading and executing it. Unlike viruses, Trojans do not replicate themselves but can create backdoors, steal data, or install additional malware once inside a system (Symantec, 2021).</p>
            <p>Trojans often spread through malicious email attachments, fake software downloads, or compromised websites. Because they appear harmless, many users unknowingly install them, allowing attackers to gain control over their systems.</p>

            <h2>What Does a Trojan Do to a Computer?</h2>
            <p>Once executed, a Trojan can have severe consequences, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Theft</strong> – Many Trojans log keystrokes, steal passwords, or extract sensitive financial information.</li>
                <li><strong>System Hijacking</strong> – Some Trojans create backdoors, allowing hackers to remotely control the infected device.</li>
                <li><strong>Download and Install More Malware</strong> – Trojans can serve as a gateway for additional threats like ransomware, spyware, or cryptocurrency miners.</li>
                <li><strong>Disrupt System Performance</strong> – Many Trojans consume CPU and memory resources, slowing down computers or causing crashes.</li>
                <li><strong>Turn Devices into Botnets</strong> – Some Trojans convert infected computers into bots for launching cyberattacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks (McAfee, 2022).</li>
