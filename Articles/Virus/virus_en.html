                <h2> What is a Computer Virus?</h2>
                <p>
                    A computer virus is a type of malicious software (malware) that attaches itself to a program 
                    or file and spreads when executed. Like a biological virus, it can replicate itself and infect 
                    other files or systems, often without the user's knowledge. The term "virus" was first 
                    coined in the 1980s, though the concept of self-replicating programs dates back to earlier 
                    decades (Cohen, 1987).

                 <h2> What Does a Computer Virus Do? </h2>
                 <p> Computer viruses come in many forms and serve different malicious purposes. Some of
                    the common effects of a virus include:
                 </p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Corruption</strong> - Viruses may delete or alter files, making them unusable.</li>
                    <li><strong>System Slowdown</strong> - Many viruses consume system resources, causing computers to lag.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unauthorized Access</strong> - Some viruses allow hackers to gain control of a system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spreading to Other Devices</strong> - Certain viruses replicate through USB drives, networks, or email attachments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ransomware Attacks</strong> - Some modern viruses, like ransomware, lock users out of their files until a ransom is paid (Europol, 2021).</li>
                 </ul>

                  <h2> How to Combat and Remove Computer Viruses</h2>

                  <h3> Prevention is Key! </h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong> Use Antivirus Software </strong> - Programs like Windows Defender, Norton, or McAfee help detect and remove viruses.</li>
                    <li><strong> Keep Software Updated </strong> - Security patches help fix vulnerabilities that viruses exploit.</li>
                    <li><strong> Avoid Suspicious Links and Attachments </strong> - Phishing emails and unverified downloads are common infection methods.</li>
                    <li><strong> Enable a Firewall </strong> - Firewalls act as a barrier to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                  </ul>
