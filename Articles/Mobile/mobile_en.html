            <h2>What Does Mobile Malware Do?</h2>
            <p>Mobile malware can have various harmful effects on your device and your personal data. Here are some common things that mobile malware can do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Steal Personal Information:</strong> Mobile malware can track your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, contacts, and photos, and send it to cybercriminals.</li>
                <li><strong>Spy on Your Activities:</strong> Some types of malware can secretly track your activities, such as recording your calls, listening to your conversations, or even taking screenshots of what you’re doing.</li>
                <li><strong>Drain Your Battery and Data:</strong> Malware can secretly use up your device’s resources, like battery power or data, which can make your phone slow down or use up your mobile data plan quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Display Unwanted Ads or Redirect to Malicious Websites:</strong> Some malware causes your phone to display pop-up ads or redirects you to fake websites, which could steal your personal details or infect your device further.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> In some cases, mobile malware can lock you out of your device, demanding a ransom before you can get your information back or regain access to your phone (Europol, 2021).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Combat and Handle Mobile Malware</h2>

            <h3>Prevention is Key</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Download Apps from Trusted Sources:</strong> Only download apps from official app stores, like Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store. Avoid third-party sites, as they may offer apps with hidden malware.</li>
                <li><strong>Read App Permissions:</strong> Always check the permissions an app requests before downloading. If an app asks for more permissions than it needs, like access to your contacts, camera, or messages, it could be suspicious.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Your Device Updated:</strong> Regular updates to your phone’s operating system and apps are important because they include security patches that fix vulnerabilities malware could exploit.</li>
                <li><strong>Install Antivirus or Anti-Malware Apps:</strong> Use trusted antivirus software designed for mobile devices to detect and remove malicious apps or files. These apps can scan your phone for potential threats.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Handle Mobile Malware</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Uninstall Suspicious Apps:</strong> If you think your phone has malware, start by uninstalling any apps that you don’t recognize or that are behaving strangely. These apps could be the source of the problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Run a Security Scan:</strong> Use your antivirus app to scan your device for malware. It will help detect any malicious software hiding on your phone and guide you through the removal process.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Cache and Data:</strong> Sometimes malware hides in your phone’s cache or data. Go into your settings and clear the cache or data of any suspicious apps to remove any harmful files.</li>
                <li><strong>Factory Reset:</strong> If your phone is heavily infected and you can’t remove the malware, you may need to perform a factory reset. This will wipe all the data from your phone, so make sure to back up important files before doing it.</li>
            </ul>
